METADATA
========
Metadata consist of information that characterizes data.
Metadata are used to provide documentation for data products.
In essence, metadata answer who, what, when, where, why, and how about
every facet of the data that are being documented.

METADATA AND PRIVACY
====================
Metadata within a file can tell a lot about you.
Cameras record data about when a picture was taken and what
camera was used. Office documents like PDF or Office automatically adds
author and company information to documents and spreadsheets.
Maybe you don't want to disclose those information on the web.

 * python-gi, python-gobject for the GUI
 * shred (should be already installed)

See FORMATS

HOW TO IMPLEMENT NEW FORMATS

1. Add the format's mimetype to the STRIPPER list in mat.py
2. Inherit the GenericParser class (parser.py)
3. Read the parser.py module
4. Implement at least these three methods:
    - is_clean(self)
    - remove_all(self)
